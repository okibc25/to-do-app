# To-do-app

There were to assignments for this app:

1. This assignment focused on learning about events, event listeners, and event handlers by building a simple to-do all which 
allows the user to create new to-dos and mark existing to-dos as a complete with a checkbox. 

2. This assignment focused on learning about state and UI, and how using both can improve the readability of our code. 
We also learned that approaching UI as a function of state which can make the code easier to maintain and reuse. Approaching UI 
as a function of state is the approach taken by React.
